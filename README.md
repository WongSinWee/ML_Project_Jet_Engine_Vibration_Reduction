# ML_Project_Jet_Engine_Vibration_Reduction

## An Industry Use Case
When i was Whole Engine Design engineer, one of the main problem facing was the jet engine failed test due to high vibration, till date many additional steps been added to the build process. I tried to correlate with simple linear regression using the measurement data at build but found there is no relationship. Now,I am Certification engineer where the each engine's build record and data converged to the department, with the availble data it revive my curiousity. It was greteful this project idea been supported by the group and warm welcomed by lecturer as actual industry use case project.

This is a group project for Data Analysis for Sense Making course was conduction during Covid19. The project is to study the feasibility of how machine learning can reducing the test reject of newly build jet engine due to vibration and how to implementation the solution. Due to Covid-19 the whole course was conducted through Zoom, and the group project was completed through the MS Team meeting and file sharing with the team member. 

## Solution Based On Design Thinking Methodology
Before go straight into the data crunching, we started the project with a guiding principle based on design think which create solution to solve the high test bed reject of the engine production.

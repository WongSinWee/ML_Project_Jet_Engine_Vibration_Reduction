# ML_Project_Jet_Engine_Vibration_Reduction
When i was Whole Engine Design engineer, one of the main problem facing is the jet engine failed test due to high vibration. I tried to correlate with simple linear regression using the measurement data at build but found there is no relationship. Now,I am Certification engineer where the each engine's build record and data converged to the department, i am able to collect the project easily

The is a group project to study the feasibility of how machine learning can reducing the test reject of newly build jet engine due to vibration.
